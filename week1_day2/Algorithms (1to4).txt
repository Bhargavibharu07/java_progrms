1. write an algorithm to find whether a number is even or odd

    step1:-start
    step2:-Read the number
    step3:-if the number is divisible by 2(remainder is 0)
               print number is even
          else
              print number is odd
   step4:-stop


2.write a algorithm to find wheather a person is eligible to vote or not(age>18 eligible to vote)


          step1:-start
          step2:-Read the age
          step3:-if(age>18)
                    print"eligible to vote"
                  else
                     print"not eligible to vote"
          step4:-stop


3.write an algorithm to find wheather a student is eligible to take admission in a college(if percentage is greater than 85 then he is eligible to take admission)


               step1.start
               step2.read the pencentage of students
               step3.if (percentage>85)
                       print"eligible"
                  else
                       print"Not eligible"
                 step4.stop

4.write an algorithm to find the biggest of two numbers

          step1:-start
          step2:-Read the numbers number1,number2
          step3:-if(number1>number2)
                    print"number1 is bigger"
                 else
                    print "number2 is bigger"
           step4:-stop
